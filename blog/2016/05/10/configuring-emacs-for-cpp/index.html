<h1>Configuring Emacs for C++</h1>
<p>
About every six months I think to myself: "I should configure Emacs to be a better C++ environment, with IDE-like features!". It invariably ends in tears and frustration, which takes roughly the aforementioned six months to forget.
</p>

<p>
Today was that day.
</p>

<p>
To make things a bit harder, I also decided to re-architect my init-file using <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a>. I had some automatic package installation before, but configuration was a mess.
</p>

<p>
So, what to use for C++ development? I have some requirements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cmake support</li>
<li>ninja support</li>
<li>completion support</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have tried <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/cpputils-cmake">cpputils-cmake</a> before, but unfortunately it needs makefiles to parse the compiler flags. I have also tried <a href="https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide">cmake-ide</a>, but I could never get it configured quite right, and it felt slow. I figured, maybe my new use-package based configuration is easier to get right? Let's give it a shot.
</p>

<p>
I made a minimal cmake-ide and company-mode configuration, something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(use-package company
  :ensure t
  :init
  (global-company-mode))

(use-package cmake-ide
  :ensure t
  :init
  (cmake-ide-setup))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Hmm. It kind of works, but why does it create new cmake build folders all the time? Let's set cmake-ide-build-dir to something, using a .dir-locals.el file in the root of the project (replace PROJECT_ROOT with the proper path):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">((nil . ((cmake-ide-build-dir . "&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/build"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now it runs cmake in the proper place, and cmake-ide-compile seems to do the right thing. But now completion fails with a rather large error message. What's wrong? Oh, it seems to be missing system includes. Let's fix it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(use-package cmake-ide
  :ensure t
  :init
  (use-package semantic/bovine/gcc)
  (setq cmake-ide-flags-c++ (append '("-std=c++11")
				    (mapcar (lambda (path) (concat "-I" path)) (semantic-gcc-get-include-paths "c++"))))
  (setq cmake-ide-flags-c (append (mapcar (lambda (path) (concat "-I" path)) (semantic-gcc-get-include-paths "c"))))
  (cmake-ide-setup))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ok, now it works <i>sometimes</i>. But darn, it is slow as molasses. It has to compile the whole file for every completion with company-clang, and doesn't cache anything. :(
</p>

<p>
The tears and frustration are looming. 
</p>

<p>
Let's try <a href="https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode">irony-mode</a> instead. It's built on libclang, and runs a server process in the background. This means that emacs doesn't need to hang while waiting for completions. And it can keep state cached between queries.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(use-package irony
  :ensure t
  :config
  (use-package company-irony
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-irony))
  (use-package company-irony-c-headers
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-irony-c-headers))
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  ;; replace the `completion-at-point' and `complete-symbol' bindings in
  ;; irony-mode's buffers by irony-mode's function
  (defun my-irony-mode-hook ()
    (define-key irony-mode-map [remap completion-at-point]
      'irony-completion-at-point-async)
    (define-key irony-mode-map [remap complete-symbol]
      'irony-completion-at-point-async))
  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'my-irony-mode-hook)
  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I added the company-irony and company-irony-c-headers backends to company, and disabled company-clang:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(use-package company
  :ensure t
  :init
  (global-company-mode)
  :config
  (delete 'company-backends 'company-clang))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that you also need to install the server, which you can do with M-x irony-install-server. You need to have libclang-dev installed to build it.
</p>

<p>
Oh man, this works much better! The completion works, and is pretty quick too! There's still some slowness as the first file is opened, because cmake-ide needs to convert compile_commands.json produced by cmake to a format that irony likes. But it's not too bad.
</p>

<p>
Wee, no tears, no frustration!
</p>

<p>
Here's the whole shebang:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(use-package irony
  :ensure t
  :config
  (use-package company-irony
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-irony))
  (use-package company-irony-c-headers
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-irony-c-headers))
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  ;; replace the `completion-at-point' and `complete-symbol' bindings in
  ;; irony-mode's buffers by irony-mode's function
  (defun my-irony-mode-hook ()
    (define-key irony-mode-map [remap completion-at-point]
      'irony-completion-at-point-async)
    (define-key irony-mode-map [remap complete-symbol]
      'irony-completion-at-point-async))
  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'my-irony-mode-hook)
  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options))

(use-package company
  :ensure t
  :init
  (global-company-mode)
  :bind (("&lt;backtab&gt;" . company-complete-common-or-cycle))
  :config
  (delete 'company-backends 'company-clang))

(use-package cmake-ide
  :ensure t
  :init
  (use-package semantic/bovine/gcc)
  (setq cmake-ide-flags-c++ (append '("-std=c++11")
				    (mapcar (lambda (path) (concat "-I" path)) (semantic-gcc-get-include-paths "c++"))))
  (setq cmake-ide-flags-c (append (mapcar (lambda (path) (concat "-I" path)) (semantic-gcc-get-include-paths "c"))))
  (cmake-ide-setup))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And one final tip. To avoid answering popups, and having to save safe local variables to your init file, add this to the cmake-ide config:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elisp">(put 'cmake-ide-build-dir 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)
</pre>
</div>
